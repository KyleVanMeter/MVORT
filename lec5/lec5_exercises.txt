------------------------------
For all of the following questions, copy and paste the terminal commands that you use to acheive them into this file.

For example:
0. See where you are in your terminal.
pwd

1. Create a directory called "lec5_directory".
mkdir lec5_directory

2. Change directories into lec5_directory.
cd lec5_directory 

3. Create a file called "names.txt".
touch names.txt

4. Use `echo` and `>` and/or `>>` to write the names of you and your partner into the file names.txt.
echo 'Kyle Van Meter' > names.txt

5. Create a copy of "names.txt" called "names2.txt".
cp names.txt names2.txt

6. Create a directory called lec5_subdirectory and create a directory within lec5_subdirectory called subsubbasement.
mkdir lec5_directory/lec5_subdirectory
mkdir lec5_directory/lec5_subdirectory/subsubbasement

7. Move to your subsubbasement directory.
cd lec5_directory/lec5_subdirectory/subsbubasement

8. Find your full path.
pwd

9. Without changing directories, move names2.txt to the subsubbasement directory.
mv ../../names2.txt $(pwd)

10. Move back to your lec5_directory.
cd ../../

11. Create a directory called thisissilly
mkidr thisissilly

12. Using the `rm` command, remove the thisissilly directory
rm -r thisissilly/

13. Run the following code (this question does not require an answer of any kind):
for i in `seq 1 30`; do
    touch "$i.silly"
done;

14. List all files in your directory ending in .silly. Use a "*" wildcard with `ls`.
1.silly   12.silly  15.silly  18.silly  20.silly  23.silly  26.silly  29.silly  4.silly  7.silly 
10.silly  13.silly  16.silly  19.silly  21.silly  24.silly  27.silly  3.silly   5.silly  8.silly 
11.silly  14.silly  17.silly  2.silly   22.silly  25.silly  28.silly  30.silly  6.silly  9.silly 

15. Close this file (Really! close your lec5_exercises.txt file!), then move it into your lec5_directory using the `mv` command, then re-open this file.
mv ../lec5_exercises.txt $(pwd)

16. Change directories to the parent directory of lec5_directory.
cd ..

17. !DANGER! Careful not to destroy your work at this step !DANGER!
Make a copy of lec5_excerices.txt from the directory it is currently in to the directory that your terminal is currently in. Then remove that copy.
cp lec5_excerices.txt lec5_excerices.txt lec5_ex2.txt
rm lec5_ex2.txt

18. What command can you use to zip up your lec5_directory and all files and subdirectories to produce lec5.zip?
zip done.zip lec5_directory lec5_directory/*

-- If you finish early --
0. What command can you use to see the contents of lec5.zip?
zipinfo lec5.zip

1. List all files in your thisissilly directory between 10.silly and 19.silly (inclusive). Use `ls` with a "?" wildcard (matches 1 single character).

2. Use the `less` command and the `cat` command on this file. What are the differences?
cat is generally used to conCATenate multiple files into one, while less will just display text

3. Use the `head` and `tail` commands on this file. What are the differences? What does the -n flag do?
head is the first lines of the file, and tail is the end.  The -n flag is the number of lines displayed
