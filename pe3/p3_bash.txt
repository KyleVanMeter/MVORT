12) two editors are vim, and emacs
    12.1) open a file in vim with :e, or C-x C-f (find-file) in emacs
    12.2) save a file in vim with :w, or C-x C-w (write-file) in emacs
    12.3) quit the editor in vim with :q!, or C-x C-c (save-buffer-kill-terminal) in emacs (why would you ever do that though?)
13) One reason is for increased versatility, and speed at which editing/input is done.  Another is dealing with remote file (vim (or at least vi) is installed on most unix-like machines, and emacs has several ways of dealing with files on a remote host.
