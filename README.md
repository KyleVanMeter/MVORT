 * Installation:
 Requires linux, Qt5, ASSIMP, OpenMP, and Eigen3.  You should be able to download the MVORT folder, run qmake on the MVORT.pro project file to generate a usable Makefile.  Do note that the location of my Qt5 installation, and other library files are likely different than yours.  Look at Build.md for more details
 
 * Running:
 While there is basic usability printing (-h) the basics are: ./MVORT -f [filename.{png|ppm|jpg}] to render an image from the internally defined scene.
