# Running tests
1) How do you create your test executable?



2) What are the results of running  `./test`?



3) What command can you run to list verbose results of all test cases, even ones that successfully passed? (run ./test -? to list available commands)


# About writing tests

1) Most testing frameworks include some kind of "setup" function. What does this function do? Most testing frameworks include some kind of "teardown" function. What does this function do? (http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs3215/tools/cppunitAll.html)



2) Notice that the link supplied was not to the Catch documentation. Does Catch have setup and teardown functions? If not, what does it have instead & what is the argument for a different solution?



3) What type of statement can you give Catch's REQUIRE macro?



4) What makes the TEST_CASE macro different from the SECTION macro?



5) You should only test one functionality in each SECTION. Why is this?  



# Actually writing tests

1) Write a test that finds the bug in the Factorial function. Copy + paste that test here.
