PE 6 (refactoring)
==============


In this exercise you will take code that could be significantly improved and [refactor it according to the guidelines from lecture 4](../lectures/4_cpp_structs_objects_part3/coding_practices/codingpractices.md).


Refactor the [provided code](pe6_code/) so that it follows the previously discussed guidelines. If you have never worked with maps before, these are standard data structures that you will find in any language. In python, they are called "dictionaries". They associate a unique key with a value. Here are [two](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map) [references](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/map-associative-containers-the-c-standard-template-library-stl/) for you to get started.
- __To turn in__:
    - main.cpp, Society.h, and Society.cpp
    - You do not need to turn in the Makefile, as you should not need to change it
