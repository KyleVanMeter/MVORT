PE 4 (git prompt)
==============

Part 1:  

Answer the quiz questions regarding version control basics on canvas.

Part 2:
Using the materials from lecture on Tuesday ([lecture 5](../lectures/5_bash_terminal/bashrc_starter)), edit your `.bashrc` so that your PS1 (command line prompt) provides the following information on your command line about your git repos (if your working directory is a git repo):
- clean vs. dirty
- what branch you are on

Your prompt must use at least 3 different colors. To complete this exercise, turn in your .bashrc file and a screen shot showing your prompt indicating both different states above when in a git repo. Your prompt should not break when not in a git repo.

For those of you who currently use `zsh` or any other non-bash unix shell--[read about how to change your shell](http://www.peachpit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=659655&seqNum=3) and implement your own PS1 in bash.

Extras! (for fun AND functionality)
- Add an indication for whether or not your branch is ahead of remote. If you are already experienced with git, doing this is recommended!
- Customize [the other information displayed in your prompt](https://ss64.com/bash/syntax-prompt.html)

__Turn in:__ pe4.zip, including your .bashrc file and a picture showing your prompt in the following three states:
1. not in a git repo
2. in a clean git repo
3. in a dirty repo
4. (anything else you want to show us)
