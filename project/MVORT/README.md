 * Installation
 Requires linux, and Qt5.  You should be able to download the MVORT folder, run qmake on the MVORT.pro project file to generate a usable Makefile.  Do not that the location of my Qt5 installation is likely different than yours.
 
 * Running
 While there is basic usability printing (-h) the basics are: ./MVORT [filename.{png|ppm|jpg}] to render an image from the internally defined scene.
