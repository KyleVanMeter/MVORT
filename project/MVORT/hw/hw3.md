* What I wanted to accomplish by this deadline:  In the proposal I said that I wanted to get the basics of a raytracer working.  This includes topics like anti-aliasing, materials, reflections, refractions, positional cameras, depth of field, lights, and textures.

* What I actually accomplished: I was actually able to do most of the above (plus a little more incorperating the ability to output different image encodings rather than just .ppm).  I was able to do all _but_ lights, and textures from simple math fatigue.  There is no technical roadblock stopping me from finishing these; I just need to sit down and do them.

* By next deadline: By next deadline I'm going to have a raytracer which can import model data (which will also have the effect of the raytracer not being limited to only spheres).  Along with this I would like some way in which scene data can be inputted, for now I'm thinking of just extending use of command line options rather than trying to make a robust file format.
